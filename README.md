# Development Environment Setup

This guide outlines the steps required to set up a new development environment, particularly focusing on Supabase and Stripe integration.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Supabase project
- Stripe account with permissions to create new environments
- Node.js and npm/npx installed

## Setup Steps

### 1. Reset Supabase Database

```bash
supabase db reset
```

### 2. Create New Stripe Environment

1. Navigate to your Stripe Dashboard
2. Create a new environment for the project
3. Note down the Secret Key for the next steps

### 3. Configure Environment and Run Setup Script

1. Add the Stripe Secret Key to your environment variables
2. Execute the setup script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/setup.ts
```

### 4. Sync Remote Environment (Pre-Stripe Merge Only)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This step must be executed BEFORE merging Stripe changes. After merging, the Stripe environment will sync with local, requiring test environment reconstruction.

If you need to reset a linked Supabase environment to sync with local:

```bash
supabase db reset --linked
```

### 5. Execute Stripe Console Setup

1. Using the Secret Key from step 2, execute the Stripe setup SQL:

```bash
# Modify the API key in the file before running
psql -f migrations/1_stripe_setup_console.sql
```

### 6. Import Plan Data

Execute the generated plans SQL script in Supabase:

```bash
# Run the SQL script generated in step 3
psql -f scripts/insert_plans.sql
```

## Important Notes

- The order of operations is crucial, particularly regarding the timing of the Supabase reset relative to Stripe merges
- Always verify environment variables are correctly set before running scripts
- Keep your Stripe Secret Keys secure and never commit them to version control

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. Verify all prerequisites are met
2. Ensure correct environment variables are set
3. Check Stripe API key permissions
4. Confirm Supabase connection details are correct
